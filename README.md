# Construction-Detection-RasterVision
Python code for detecting construction sites from High-Resolution satellite imagery using Raster Vision, consists of both training and inference.

Here I used [tmstogeotiff](https://github.com/gumblex/tms2geotiff) to download high resolution satellite imagery to train the model and predict. I used Raster Vision library for training and prediction.You can find the code for training and inference in notebook:'Construction Detection using Raster Vision.ipynb'.

Example:
